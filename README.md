# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment retail or e-commerce customers based on their purchasing behavior, frequency, and spending. The goal is to enable more **targeted marketing**, **personalized promotions**, and **improved customer experience** through data-driven segmentation.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Retail and e-commerce businesses often deal with a large and diverse customer base. A one-size-fits-all marketing strategy fails to address the needs and behaviors of different customer groups.

This project uses **K-Means Clustering** to:
- Group customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics or other behavioral features
- Understand customer profiles and value tiers
- Provide actionable insights for marketing and personalization strategies

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model**: K-Means Clustering
- **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for 2D visualization
- **Cluster Evaluation**:
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Score
